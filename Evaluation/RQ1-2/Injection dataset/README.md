# Evaluation

## Injection dataset

Sorry, we have tried uploading the APK file to GitHub but have been receiving error messages. To avoid the issue of inability to download, we have uploaded all experimental apps to Google Drive. The link to Google Cloud Drive is as follows: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aUn6T4sm4nD5M7PP28F98aJ9MECZa_Om/view?usp=sharing

Due to the length limitation of the paper, we present here the app in the injection dataset and the distribution of non-crash bugs contained in the app. There are 9 categories of bugs, and we have injected 8 bugs for each categories.
