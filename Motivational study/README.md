# Motivational study

In order to better understand the characteristics and distribution of non crash bugs, we conducted a motivational study, which was not included in this paper due to space limitations. Here are some data and examples of non crash defects provided.


Our experimental dataset is collected from one of the largest open-source Android app hosting websites (GitHub), which has a great number of Android bug reports. We employ the following criteria for app selection: more than 1K downloads in Google Play (popular), a public issue tracking system (traceable), and more than three years of development history (trustworthy). A total of 3,128 open-source Android apps with 57,326 bug reports are selected in this study. These apps belong to diversified categories such as business, communication, finance, etc. For the selected apps, we randomly select 6,000 bug reports involving 576 apps with detailed bug descriptions and GIFs/screenshots, and conduct manual analysis. Among them, 4,856 (81%) bug reports are related to the functional aspects of the app, while the rest are about the performance, security, etc. These functional bugs include 1,796 crash bugs (37%), and 3,060 non-crash functional bugs (63%). Since the crash bugs have been widely studied in previous work, we further investigate the non-crash functional bugs.

Non-crash functional bug denotes these bugs related to multiple GUI pages, i.e., involving a testing sequence to trigger it, with details in figure (Distribution of non cash functional bugs).  Among them, data operation failures mainly manifested as failures in adding, deleting, and modifying data, such as failed user information updates, errors in adding or removing shopping cart items, etc. Media control no-response mainly involves issues with video and audio playback, such as no response of playback control (failure of play, pause, stop functions). Numerical calculation errors mainly include mathematical errors, inaccurate statistical data, and cost calculation deviations. Setting and configuration failures mainly manifested as users being unable to save personalized settings or configurations, including ineffective or reset settings within the app (such as notification switches and theme changes). Navigation and link errors mainly manifested as page redirection errors and confusion in navigation logic between functions.
